Write a method `palindrome?` that outputs whether a given input is a palindromic word.

Write tests to verify that your method works correctly for normal words, empty inputs, and malformed inputs.

#### Expected Behavior:

`palindrome?('noon') => true`

`palindrome?('hello') => false`

`palindrome?(42) => false`
